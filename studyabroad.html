    <h2>Study Abroad Travel Advice</h2>
    <p>While I was studying abroad, I did a lot of traveling. Over my time there, I visited 13 countries in five months. This took a lot of organization and planning. Below, I've shared some pictures from my travels and a small snapshot of my itinerary on Microsoft Excel. If my experiences interest you, please reach out to me using my Contact form and I can see if I can help you out! Thanks!<br>

        <p>Amsterdam was a 2.5 hour train ride from my home in Maastricht. I was lucky to be able to visit Amsterdam six times in my time abroad, which was one of my favorite cities in Europe in one of my favorite countries in Europe. One of my favorite museums I visited was the Picasso in Amsterdam.</p>

        <p>This spreadsheet shows all of the beautiful and interesting places I was able to visit in my time abroad. Our traveling involved a significant amount of planning, and for some of the trips, it would have been nice to have some live advice along the way. As you can see on the sheet, we figured out all of the dates we had to travel on the left first. We then planned all of the places in the middle column based on where we wanted to go to the most and flight prices. In our notes tab, we figured out logistics of our flight times, etc. If any of these trips interest you and you want to reach out to me for some travel advice, or just to ask me about my experience there, please do so using the Contact form. Thanks! As a side note, if you would like to enlarge the image of the spreadsheet, please just click on the link of "Trip Planning" above.</p>
